# Guestbook

REQUIREMENTS

You have been asked by your client to create an online Guestbook. It will allow guests to
sign, and allow everyone else to see all the messages that have been posted. 

Build an application that allows users to add posts, list all posts, view and delete single post. Guests are allowed to update and/or delete anyone's posts. 

Your client has requested specifically for a unified look across all your pages. Your program manager has made these styling mandatory:

Same navigation bar across all pages. 
In the navigation bar, give your app a name (eg. "Taylor&Oscar's Wedding")
Each button must have meaningful names (ie. "Home" is fine. "Link1" or "Page1" is not.)
Each post should have, at the very least : 

name
date
wishes
Features/Functionalities:

The home page ("/") path should point to a list of all Guestbook posts
Every page (or template) should have link (or button) to the add path 
("/add") which will lead to the new post form
Use a collection (arrays, array list, hash maps, etc) to store all posts
The user should be able to update and view single posts on their own page.
Add Bootstrap and styling to make your pages look Professional.
Don't forget about the README.md.
Once your application is working, put it on GitHub. 
Submit your GitHub repository link.

- Add an appropriately-sized image to your navigation bar as a clickable link to your home page.
